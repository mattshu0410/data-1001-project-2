DATA1001 Project 2

Hello group members. This will serve as a DATA1001 Project repository page. Here is a guide on how to use Github to add to the code. There are different versions of our project called branches. We have a main branch which is our main document. You, as a group member can create new branches and do editing however you like. These newly created branches can then be merged into the main branch once changes are approved.
 

Every time you wish to make an edit to the existing Rmd file first you must clone and download it. You can work on the downloaded file as you normal would in RStudio. You can then create a new branch and upload your work. After this, submit a pull request to request one of your other team members to check your work and confirm the merge. Click on this link for more details on how it all works: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ 

If you wish to set up your RStudio so that you can push and pull straight from R as opposed to downloading the file each time, it is a little bit more complicated. If you are tech-savvy then use this link to learn how. https://cfss.uchicago.edu/setup/git-with-rstudio/
